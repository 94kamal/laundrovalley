# e-laundromat
Fully automated e-Laundry system with automated email notifications, scheduling of tasks, plan suggestions via analyzing previous data using classification tree algorithm.Implemented Design Patterns including Observer, Factory, Singleton and Pure Fabrication  


Introduction  
In some large college campuses like BITS Pilani ,there is no central laundry management. There are local
laundry facilities but getting information about the pickup and delivery of washed clothes requires
the individual to call the laundry services, also the other information like - when will the laundry
service man visit the hostel for picking up soiled clothes etc.
LaundroValley is a central laundry management system specially designed for students and laundry
service providers. It is a central platform where the laundry service provider meets the college
students.

Scope  
This software will be an e-Laundry System for the Vendor of Laundry Services. This
software will be designed to maximize the Vendor's productivity by providing tools to assist in
automating various processes which would otherwise have to be performed manually. By
maximizing the vendor’s work efficiency and production the system will meet the vendor’s needs
while remaining easy to understand and use.
More specifically, this system is designed to allow a Vendor to manage Customers. The system also
contains a relational database containing a list of Customers (students in our case), Vendor's Staff
and Subscription Plans.
This System also provides a way to provide feedback so that the vendor can improve its services.
